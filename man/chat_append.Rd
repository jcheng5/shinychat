\title{Append an assistant response (or user message) to a chat control}
\usage{
chat_append(
  id,
  response,
  role = c("assistant", "user"),
  session = getDefaultReactiveDomain()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{id}{The ID of the chat element}

\item{response}{The message or message stream to append to the chat element}

\item{role}{The role of the message (either "assistant" or "user"). Defaults
to "assistant".}

\item{session}{The Shiny session object}
}
\value{
Returns a promise. This promise resolves when the message has been
successfully sent to the client; note that it does not guarantee that the
message was actually received or rendered by the client. The promise
rejects if an error occurs while processing the response (see the "Error
handling" section).
}
\description{
The \code{chat_append} function appends a message to an existing chat control. The
\code{response} can be a string, string generator, string promise, or string
promise generator (as returned by the {elmer} package's \code{chat}, \code{stream},
\code{chat_async}, and \code{stream_async} methods, respectively).

This function should be called from a Shiny app's server. It is generally
used to append the model's response to the chat, while user messages are
added to the chat UI automatically by the front-end. You'd only need to use
\code{chat_append(role="user")} if you are programmatically generating queries
from the server and sending them on behalf of the user, and want them to be
reflected in the UI.
}
\section{Error handling}{
If the \code{response} argument is a generator, promise, or promise generator, and
an error occurs while producing the message (e.g. an elmer chat object errors
during \code{stream_async}), the promise returned by \code{chat_append} will reject
with the error. If the \code{chat_append} call is the last expression in a Shiny
observer, Shiny will see that the observer failed, and end the user session.
If you prefer to handle the error gracefully, use \code{\link[promises:then]{promises::catch()}} on the
promise returned by \code{chat_append}.
